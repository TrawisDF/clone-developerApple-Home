## Try to learn and pratice tailwind css 

All sources code were writtren on my thought, not real layout of the website. I only clone it for main page not deal with any function. 
I did some responsive design that was used on the web as much as I can with my tailwind css skills.


here's my static web that deploy on onreder.com
